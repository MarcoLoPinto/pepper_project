# PepperTale: Interactive Storytelling with Pepper
Unlike typical scripted storytellers, PepperTale is an intelligent agent that collaboratively builds 
narratives with users. While the robot has its own narrative objectives, users engage in a creative 
tug-of-war to shape the story's outcome. <br>

PepperTale is able to craft a compelling story together with the user, telling it with words while mimicking 
with its body the mood and spirit of the events happening in the story. Every action chosen by the robot 
is a direct consequence of the user selected action, and is chosen intelligently to get to one of its 
wanted goals while counteracting the user actions. <br>

The robot uses speech recognition to receive the input from the user and uses the camera to do face detection 
and recognition, so to be able to address each user in a more personalized way. Finally, a screen is used as 
secondary aid to the interaction, showing in textual form what the robot says and giving feedback for the 
speech and face recognition.
