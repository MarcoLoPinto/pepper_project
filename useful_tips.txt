cd iocchi-hri_software/docker/
./run.bash

# To see all images in docker, do:
docker images

# To list active containers:

Then press d (for "detach").

# If you want to completely destroy the tmux session, including all of its windows and panes:
Type exit or Ctrl-d to exit all shells and processes running inside the tmux session.
Type tmux kill-session to destroy the tmux session.
This will completely destroy the tmux session and all of its associated processes.
