# Run an image
cd iocchi-hri_software/docker/
./run.bash

# After running, access the container via:
docker exec -it pepperhri tmux a

# To see all images in docker, do:
docker images

# To list active containers:
docker container ls

# To stop a container:
docker container stop <container_id>

# To exit the tmux session and detach from it without destroying it, you can use the following key combination:
Press Ctrl-b (the prefix key for tmux commands).
Then press d (for "detach").
This will detach you from the tmux session and return you to the Docker host shell.

# If you want to completely destroy the tmux session, including all of its windows and panes, you can do the following:
Attach to the tmux session using the same command you used before: docker exec -it pepperhri tmux a.
Type exit or Ctrl-d to exit all shells and processes running inside the tmux session.
Type tmux kill-session to destroy the tmux session.
This will completely destroy the tmux session and all of its associated processes.
